I have built websites before. But the design was always an after thought. Thus,
designing the website was a new experience for me.


Things I struggled with:
  =======================
  Responsive design - it's hard to build a site that does well on multiple 
  screen sizes. I read two books on responsive web design and several posts 
  online on the topic. The conclusion was while you can get far with media
  queries, fluid designs, etc.. the future is something like flexbox by mozzila.

  I would use flexbox on a real project, given the right requirements, but
  in this case I just used max-widths, ems, and percentages along with a limited
  media query to do the project.

  =======================
  ids vs class - I understand their use but its not obvious to me when 
  to use one vs another at the start.

  i didn't overcome this problem.

  =======================
  css structure - sometimes a heiarchy isn't important, should i just 
  push things to the left or layer things?

  .nav

  .link

  VS

  .nav
    .link

  I end ended up layering in most cases

  =======================
  DRY css - I feel like with some slight tweeks i could have half the code.
  But a lot of code shared code doesn't have an obvious parent. TODO

  sass helps but i'm sure with more experience i'll get better at this

  =======================
  nameing stuff - naming variables is always hard. I think better names 
  comes with better understanding of what your doing and keeping things 
  dry. Example gallery_select, probably should just be 'select' under
  gallery...
